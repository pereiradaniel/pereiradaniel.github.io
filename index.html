						Homegrown is the app that connects urban/sub-urban farmers with people hungry for fresh Homegrown foods!

					<p class="paragraph">
						One day while walking through the ravine paths of Scarborough with his dog Hunter, Daniel was struck by a bolt of creativity: there was no app to connect gardeners with people willing to buy or trade their Homegrown produce and preservatives.  Many years and many kilometers walked along these paths had informed him just how many people were avid gardeners.  Daniel knew that there had to be a way to bring these people together, to share their hobby and to make a difference in the city.
					</p>
					<h3 class="paragraph-title">What does it do?</h3>
					<p class="paragraph">
						Gardeners can easily register for an account, set up a garden page, and list their produce along with photos.
						Users (with or without gardens) can search for produce by proximity to their location, and send a trade request.
					</p>
					<h3 class="paragraph-title">How will Homegrown make a difference?</h3>
					<p class="paragraph">
						Daniel is currently working on features that will make it possible for Homegrown users to make a difference in their community.  The ultimate vision is to have Homegrown users donating to foodbanks, and connect seniors with gardeners willing to donate time and effort to maintaining flowers and small gardens.

			<h1>Bio page</h1>
				<section>
					<p class="paragraph-title">
						A full-stack web developer involved in tech startups, Daniel specializes in developing mobile-first apps with Rails and Meteor.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						Daniel is a project leader of Homegrown, a tech start-up in Toronto that originated as a passion project.  He is involved in tech start-ups through contracts, and works on various parts of the stack.  Daniel is capable of building apps from the ground up using Rails, and currently pursuing this level of proficiency using the Meteor platform.  While staying busy developing new apps, Daniel is taking a part-time course on ad-optimization.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						At the age of 3, he learned to use his first computer, an ATARI 600XL.  This summer, he rebuilt a completely disassembled Macintosh 512k.  Daniel learned to disassemble, reassemble, and perform maintenance on computers at a young age, and soon discovered that DOS 6.2 came packaged with QBASIC.  This lead to a keen interest in programming.  His fondest memory of working with computers was repairing and refurbishing computers that were shipped to schools around the world.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						In the health and fitness industry, Daniel became known for expertly programming and handling large volume bootcamps.  As founder of True North Training, Daniel is cursed by his clients for breaking habits, and making their home a place of exercise.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						Daniel built a computer-centric recording studio in 2003, and became part of Toronto's reggae scene.  In elementary school, Daniel began teaching hismelf BASIC.  By 14 he was rebuilding and refurbishing donated computers for schools in developing countries.  An ideal Saturday consists of a morning all-terrain run, a walk with Hunter in the Rouge Valley, and a couple hours playing classical guitar.
