					<p class="paragraph">
						One day while walking through the ravine paths of Scarborough with his dog Hunter, Daniel was struck by a bolt of creativity: there was no app to connect gardeners with people willing to buy or trade their Homegrown produce and preservatives.  Many years and many kilometers walked along these paths had informed him just how many people were avid gardeners.  Daniel knew that there had to be a way to bring these people together, to share their hobby and to make a difference in the city.
					</p>
					<h3 class="paragraph-title">What does it do?</h3>
					<p class="paragraph">
						Gardeners can easily register for an account, set up a garden page, and list their produce along with photos.
						Users (with or without gardens) can search for produce by proximity to their location, and send a trade request.
					</p>
					<h3 class="paragraph-title">How will Homegrown make a difference?</h3>
					<p class="paragraph">
						Daniel is currently working on features that will make it possible for Homegrown users to make a difference in their community.  The ultimate vision is to have Homegrown users donating to foodbanks, and connect seniors with gardeners willing to donate time and effort to maintaining flowers and small gardens.

			<h1>Bio page</h1>
				<section>
					<p class="paragraph-title">
						Daniel is a full-stack web developer interested in tech startups.  He specializes in developing mobile-first apps in Rails, and is currently learning Meteor.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						At the age of 3, he learned to use his first computer, an ATARI 600XL.  This summer, he rebuilt a completely disassembled Macintosh 512k.  Daniel learned to disassemble, reassemble, and perform maintenance on computers, because as a youth, scrounging for parts and slapping them together was the only way he could own and operate a computer!  His systems were always older machines, but he learned to make the most of them, and soon discovered that DOS 6.2 came packaged with QBASIC.  This lead to a keen interest in programming, which he could learn without having the latest, greatest machines.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						His fondest memory of working with computers was his first real job at 14 years old.  "Computers for Schools" was operating out of the Bell Canada Data-Pac building where his father was a Bell technician.  The company was donated thousands of obsolete computers belonging to major corporations in Toronto.  The warehouse was filled to the brim with IBM XT's, PS/2's, dozens of Compaq Portables, and it was a fantasy land for vintage computer junkies!  With no formal training, he put together these systems at lightning speed, and found it a total drag to leave in September to go to high school.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						Although it was his life dream (after being an astronaut or a pilot) to become a computer programmer, he put aside the dream when he was forcefully dropped from an advanced computer programming course in high school, because his grade 10 French marks were low.  He still passed French, but the resistance he faced, especially from the school staff, caused him to focus his attention on music production.  So Daniel ditched that uncooperative school to take a computers and music course at another.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						It was on this course that Daniel used his first Macintosh...
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						In the health and fitness industry, Daniel became known for expertly programming and handling large volume bootcamps.  As founder of True North Training, Daniel is cursed by his clients for breaking habits, and making their home a place of exercise.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						Daniel built a computer-centric recording studio in 2003, and became part of Toronto's reggae scene.  In elementary school, Daniel began teaching hismelf BASIC.  By 14 he was rebuilding and refurbishing donated computers for schools in developing countries.  An ideal Saturday consists of a morning all-terrain run, a walk with Hunter in the Rouge Valley, and a couple hours playing classical guitar.
