						Homegrown is the app that connects urban/sub-urban farmers with people hungry for fresh Homegrown foods!
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						One day while walking through the ravine paths of Scarborough with his dog Hunter, Daniel was struck by a bolt of creativity: there was no app to connect gardeners with people willing to buy or trade their Homegrown produce and preservatives.  Many years and many kilometers walked along these paths had informed him just how many people were avid gardeners.  Daniel knew that there had to be a way to bring these people together, to share their hobby and to make a difference in the city.
					</p>
					<h3 class="paragraph-title">What does it do?</h3>
					<p class="paragraph">
						Gardeners can easily register for an account, set up a garden page, and list their produce along with photos.
						Users (with or without gardens) can search for produce by proximity to their location, and send a trade request.
					</p>
					<h3 class="paragraph-title">How will Homegrown make a difference?</h3>
					<p class="paragraph">
						Daniel is currently working on features that will make it possible for Homegrown users to make a difference in their community.  The ultimate vision is to have Homegrown users donating to foodbanks, and connect seniors with gardeners willing to donate time and effort to maintaining flowers and small gardens.

					<p class="paragraph">
						Daniel is a web developer involved in the Homegrown startup.  The idea came to him while enjoying the great outdoors and thinking about his family.  He is interested in tech startups and has years of experience in small team leadership.  1986 was the year he put together his first computer, an ATARI 600XL.  This summer, he rebuilt a completely disassembled Macintosh 512k.

						In the health and fitness industry, Daniel became known for expertly programming and handling large volume bootcamps.  As founder of True North Training, Daniel is cursed by his clients for breaking habits, and making their home a place of exercise.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						Daniel built a computer-centric recording studio in 2003, and became part of Toronto's reggae scene.  In elementary school, Daniel began teaching hismelf BASIC.  By 14 he was rebuilding and refurbishing donated computers for schools in developing countries.  An ideal Saturday consists of a morning all-terrain run, a walk with Hunter in the Rouge Valley, and a couple hours playing classical guitar.
