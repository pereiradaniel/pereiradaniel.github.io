						Homegrown is the app that connects urban/sub-urban farmers with people hungry for fresh Homegrown foods!
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						One day while walking through the ravine paths of Scarborough with his dog Hunter, Daniel was struck by a bolt of creativity: there was no app to connect gardeners with people willing to buy or trade their Homegrown produce and preservatives.  Many years and many kilometers walked along these paths had informed him just how many people were avid gardeners.  Daniel knew that there had to be a way to bring these people together, to share their hobby and to make a difference in the city.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						What does it do?
						Gardeners can easily register for an account, set up a garden page, and list their produce along with photos.
						Users (with or without gardens) can search for produce by proximity to their location, and send a trade request.
					</p>
					<p class="paragraph">
						How will Homegrown make a difference?
						Daniel is currently working on features that will make it possible for Homegrown users to make a difference in their community.  The ultimate vision is to have Homegrown users donating to foodbanks, and connect seniors with gardeners willing to donate time and effort to maintaining flowers and small gardens.
